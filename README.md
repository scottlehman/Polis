# PolisFinalProject
MERN full stack app using the MERN stack with the Vote-smart and Open Secrects APIs.

# Final Project Overview
### Overview of Intended Application
* Our application will provide voters between the ages of 18-35 quick access to information for upcoming local and national elections.
    * The information presented (if available) will focus on candidate information, voting record, etc.
        * Election information should focus on timelines, early registration opportunities, and polling locations
* Value of Application
    * We feel most voters in this demographic fail to turn out to cast their vote due to lack of readily available information
        * If we can provide that platform, it may motivate younger voters to participate more in local elections
